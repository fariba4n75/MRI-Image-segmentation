# MRI Image Segmentation for MS Lesions Using Transformers

This repository contains all the code and notebooks developed for my **PhD thesis** focused on **segmentation of MRI images to detect Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions using Transformer-based models**.  

The project explores various deep learning models including U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Swin Transformer, along with evaluation metrics such as Dice and IoU.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `data/` : Preprocessed MRI dataset (TIFF format), downloadable from Google Drive.


## Getting Started

The notebooks are configured to run in **Google Colab**.  

ðŸ’¡ **Important:** Upload the dataset to your own Google Drive and update the paths in the notebooks before running.

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
