# Data

This repository does not contain the dataset directly because of GitHubâ€™s file size limits.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on the ISBI 2015 Longitudinal MS Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset.
Since the original dataset is provided in NIfTI format (.nii), I have preprocessed it and converted it into TIFF slices for easier use in this project.

Training and test data should be placed inside the data/ folder.

Each patient folder contains both the MRI slices and their corresponding mask images.

## Example structure:
```
data/
 â”œâ”€â”€ training1/
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ training01_01_flair_pp_slice_59.tiff
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ training01_01_flair_pp_slice_59+mask.tiff
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ ...
 â”œâ”€â”€ training2/
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ training02_01_flair_pp_slice_152.tiff
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ training02_01_flair_pp_slice_152+mask.tiff
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ ...
